Your Spark Streaming algorithm should maintain a state that keeps track of the longest noun seen so far associated with each distinct adjective. After each RDD, print any 5 adjectives and their associated longest nouns, as well as the longest noun associated with the adjective 'good'. Note that not every line in the data set contains exactly two words, so make sure to clean the data as they are fed into the streaming program.  The skeleton code is provided below:"
